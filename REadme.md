## Installation
- First of all, we have a certain amount of money in the cash box, a certain number of banknotes, and how does our App work?
- when the customer arrives and makes a certain purchase worth a certain amount, the cashier enters this amount in an input tag and then 
- the cashier also enters the sum given by the customer if this sum requires a refund our program goes through the cash-drawer and gives it exactly the number of dollar bills to be refunded according to the number of bills present in the cash register.
- if there are not enough tickets to refund, the program displays `INSUFFICIENT FUNDS`.
- if the amount donated by the customer is less than the total amount of the deposits, the program displays `CLOSE`.
